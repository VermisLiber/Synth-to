## Introduction

  Communication, by defination, refers to the act of efficiently imparting and exchanging information. In the present time, when data is being created exponentially every second, it is extremely important to find a way to sort, present and assimilate data in an orderly fashion. Our project aims to provide an AI powered medium to satisfy these tasks.  
## Need
  English is at present the language most commonly used to communicate regardless of platform or profession. This, however is not favourable to a lot of non native english speakers. Presentation is the key for any thought or idea to come into effect, but lack of fluency hinders the opportunity of many talented individuals. Our software will help users not only create content that are presentable but will also allow them to veiw content in a way that is easy to assimilate, both at the same platform.

## Description
  The program makes use of ntlk,textblob,sqlite,tensorflow,etc. to create an AI powered platform that will allow users to check for spelling,grammer,vocabulary and will also provide writing prompts. Besides this, it also allows user to summarise content to paragraph or points depending on user command. As an extra, it also allows users to save/open files from system(default txt), login in to an account and post their written snippets.  
## Why OneAPI

  The grand idea behing oneAPI is to enable the use of one platform for a range of different hardware,hence developers would not have to use different languages, tools and libraries when they code for CPUs and GPUs

## Future
  While the dataset used in this project is limited and the code not sophisticated enough to accurately predict and give relavent prompts, enhancements can be made to made to improve code functionality. Code can be linked to a keypad. Code can be used to predict words and phrases unfamiliar to user and to find ways to provide efficient alternatives. Dataset can be increased to include geographical slang, local interests, etc.  
## Conclusion
  Our project is one that will maintain its relavance as long as one tries to create or learn. It can be of use to people regardless of profession, field, language proeficiency and inclinations. It is also vastly useful for proper use of skill and talent.
